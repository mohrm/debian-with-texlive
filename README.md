# debian-with-texlive

This is just a plain Dockerfile to build a container that suits exclusively my purpose. I do not provide any support for it and moreover, I do not take into account
that anybody relies on this docker container. If you want to do something with it, feel free to fork it. If you want to make sure that I don't break your setup,
then fork the container itself as well.
